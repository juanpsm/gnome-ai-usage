# Provider data contract (schema version 1)

All three frontends — the GNOME Shell extension (`gnome-extension/`), the
Hyprland/Quickshell shell (`hyprland/`) and the terminal frontend
(`aiusage/render.py`) — get all of their provider data from a single backend:

```
shared provider backend (Python, stdlib only)   package/contents/tools/aiusage
  - credential discovery, HTTP, local-data reads   aiusage/providers/, aiusage/http.py
  - normalization                                  aiusage/normalize/
                 │
                 ▼  thin bash launcher, execs into the package above
  package/contents/tools/sh/get-ai-usage
                 │
          stable JSON model
           ┌─────────┼─────────┐
           ▼         ▼         ▼
        GNOME   Quickshell terminal
      extension     UI     aiusage/render.py
   (shared JS: package/contents/code/Format.js, UsageHistory.js — Quickshell only;
    the GNOME extension is plain GJS/St, not QML)
```

No frontend performs a provider network request, parses a provider response, or
computes a quota percentage or reset window. They map the fields below onto
their own widgets — or columns — and nothing else.

## Invoking the backend

```bash
get-ai-usage --provider claude            # one provider
get-ai-usage --provider claude,openai     # several providers
get-ai-usage --all                        # every enabled provider (Hyprland)
get-ai-usage --normalize < envelope.json  # replay a raw envelope, no network
get-ai-usage --list                       # known provider ids
```

The terminal frontend renders that same model, either fetching it itself or
reading an envelope on stdin:

```bash
ai-usage-cli                        # table of every enabled provider
ai-usage-cli --compact              # one line, for status bars
get-ai-usage --all | ai-usage-cli   # render a fetched envelope, no second fetch
```

`--all` respects the provider toggles in the shared settings file
(`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ai-usage-widget/hyprland-settings.json`, overridable with
`AI_USAGE_CONFIG`). `--provider` fetches exactly what was asked for, because the
GNOME extension keeps its own toggles in GSettings.

API keys come from `WIDGET_*` environment variables (what the GNOME extension
passes) or from the `keys` object of the settings file (what the Hyprland
settings page writes). The environment always wins.

## Envelope

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "updatedAt": 1785000000,
  "active": "claude",
  "providers": [ { "…provider result…" } ]
}
```

`active` is the first healthy provider, used by the Hyprland shell to pick a tab
when its remembered one disappears.

## Provider result

```json
{
  "id": "claude",
  "label": "Claude",
  "accent": "#cc785c",
  "icon": "claude-color.svg",
  "ok": true,
  "stale": false,
  "error": "",
  "updatedAt": 1785000000,
  "summary":       { "pct": 23, "text": "23%", "detail": "max", "hasChart": true },
  "quotaWindows":  [ { "…window…" } ],
  "slots":         [ { "…panel pill…" } ],
  "historyValues": { "s": 23, "w": 61 },
  "details":       { "…provider specific…" }
}
```

| field | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `icon` | brand logo filename under `contents/icons/`, `""` when the provider has no artwork yet (frontends fall back to an `accent` dot). Bare filename, not a path — the two frontends sit at different depths and each resolves the directory itself |
| `ok` | the provider produced usable data |
| `stale` | data is missing or older than this refresh |
| `error` | human-readable failure, `""` when healthy. Well-known values: `offline`, `rate limited`, `token expired`, `access denied`, `err <http status>`, `python3 missing` (unlike the others, not retried — see the bash launcher in `tools/sh/get-ai-usage`; the string is fixed vocabulary and means "no Python 3 interpreter could be resolved by `tools/sh/python-interp.sh`", not that the literal `python3` binary is absent) |
| `updatedAt` | epoch seconds when the data was collected |
| `summary.pct` | headline percentage (0–100) |
| `summary.text` | headline string, already formatted (`"23%"`, `"$12.5"`, `"CLI"`) |
| `summary.detail` | plan / account line |
| `summary.hasChart` | false when the provider has no series worth charting |
| `quotaWindows[]` | ordered rows: `key`, `label`, `pct`, `available`, `resetAt`, `resetText`, `detail`, `showMeter`, and optionally `note` |
| `note` | aside shown beside the value. Only meaningful with `showMeter: false`, where `detail` becomes the value itself and would otherwise leave the row no room for context. Optional — a frontend that ignores it loses the aside, nothing else |
| `chartWindows[]` | chart ranges — see below. Empty when the provider has no chartable series |
| `slots[]` | compact panel pills: `pct`, `color`, `text` (null → show the meter), `tooltip` |
| `historyValues` | series keys this provider contributes to the shared usage history |
| `details` | everything the detailed per-provider views render |

All timestamps are **epoch seconds**, `0` meaning "no reset known".
`resetText` is a preformatted local-time string for frontends that do not want
to format it themselves; the Quickshell shell formats from `resetAt` instead
so it keeps following the desktop locale.

### Chart windows

Which history series a provider contributes, and what each chart range means.
Both frontends render the list they are handed rather than keeping their own
copy of the table, so a provider's ranges are defined in exactly one place.

| field | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | range identifier, persisted as the user's selection (`session`, `codex_weekly`, `kiro`, …) |
| `key` | which `historyValues` series it plots |
| `label` | button text (`5H`, `24H`, `7D`, `30D`) |
| `size` | how much time the chart shows, in ms |
| `granularity` | `5h` / `24h` / `7d`, or `""` for a provider with a single fixed range. Frontends carry it across tabs so switching services keeps the range |
| `raw` | the series holds absolute money rather than percentages, so the chart auto-scales it to its own maximum |
| `resets` | the underlying quota empties periodically |
| `periodMs` | how often it empties (0 when `resets` is false) |
| `resetAt` | epoch seconds of the *next* reset, which anchors every earlier one |

`size` and `periodMs` differ for the 24H range: it plots the five-hour series
over a wider span. `periodMs` and `resetAt` are what let a frontend redraw a
reset that happened while the machine was asleep at the moment it really
happened, instead of sloping from the last pre-sleep sample to the first sample
after wake-up (`UsageHistory.withResets`).

### History series keys

| key | series |
| --- | --- |
| `s` / `w` | Claude 5-hour / 7-day |
| `cp` / `cw` | Codex 5-hour / weekly |
| `ag` | Antigravity average |
| `kr` | Kiro credits |
| `or` | OpenRouter credit usage |
| `mv` | Mistral vibe spend (absolute USD, auto-scaled by the chart) |
| `gr` | Grok credits |
| `za` | Z.AI tokens |
| `gh` | Copilot premium requests |
| `ds` | DeepSeek balance (absolute) |

### Credentials

Credentials and access tokens are **never** part of a result. The backend
exposes presence only: `details.hasKey` and `details.keyValid` for
single-credential providers, and the specific `details.hasOAuth` /
`details.hasAdminKey` / `details.hasApiKey` / `details.codexLoggedIn` for the
two that accept more than one. A contract test asserts that no fixture secret
can appear anywhere in a result.

Most helpers now report presence rather than echoing the credential back, so a
token never crosses a process boundary at all. The exceptions are
`get-openai-usage` and `get-grok-usage`, whose credentials the backend itself
needs in order to call the plan endpoints.

## `details` per provider

**claude** — `hasOAuth`, `hasAdminKey`, `subscriptionType`, `rateLimitTier`,
`organizationUuid`, `effortLevel`, `autoDream`, `session`/`weekly`
(`available`, `pct`, `resetAt`, `tokensUsed`, `tokenLimit`), `scopedWeekly`
(one entry per `weekly_scoped` limit — a narrower week that runs alongside the
all-models one, such as Fable; `key`, `label`, `model`, `available`, `pct`,
`resetAt`, and a matching `quotaWindows` row), `extraTokens`,
`extraUsage` (`enabled`, `limit`, `used`, `pct`, `currency`),
`organizationUsage` (`models` keyed by model with `input_tokens`,
`output_tokens`, `cost_usd`, `priced`, plus `totalInputTokens`,
`totalOutputTokens`, `totalCostUSD`), `stats`, `status`.

**openai** — `hasApiKey`, `codexLoggedIn`, `email`, `planType`, `orgId`,
`accountId`, `authMode`, `codex` (`available`, `limitReached`, `session`,
`weekly`, `additional[]` with `name`, `limitReached`, `session`, `weekly`),
`organizationUsage`, `stats` (plus `model` and `effortLevel` from the newest
rollout), `status`.

**antigravity** — `email`, `planType`, `promptCreditsMonthly`,
`promptCreditsAvailable`, `pct`, `googlePct`, `externalPct`, `resetAt`,
`models` keyed by model id (`displayName`, `usedPct`, `resetTime`, `resetAt`,
`isExhausted`, `hasQuota`), `groups[]` (`key`, `label`, `usedPct`, `resetAt`,
`isExhausted`, `models`).

**kiro** — `available`, `planType`, `displayName`, `displayNamePlural`,
`currentUsage`, `usageLimit`, `pct`, `remaining`, `currentOverages`,
`overageCap`, `overageCharges`, `overageRate`, `currencyCode`,
`currencySymbol`, `resetAt`.

**mistral** — `hasKey`, `keyValid`, `availableModels`, `vibe` (`sessionCount`,
`totalCost`, `totalTokens`, `promptTokens`, `completionTokens`, `totalSteps`,
`toolOk`, `toolFail`, `activeModel`, `recent`), `status`.

**openrouter** — `hasKey`, `keyValid`, `label`, `usageUSD`, `limitUSD`
(null = unlimited), `limitRemainingUSD`, `isFreeTier`, `rateLimit`, `status`.

**grok** — `hasKey`, `loggedIn`, `pct`, `used`, `monthlyLimit`, `email`,
`teamName`, `tierId`, `billingPeriodEnd`, `sessionCount`, `totalTokens`,
`totalToolCalls`, `hasBilling`, `quotaKind`, `quotaWindow`, `quotaExhausted`,
`billingError`.

**zai** — `hasKey`, `keyValid`, `level`, `token` (`pct`, `used`, `limit`,
`resetAt`), `tokenLong` (`pct`, `resetAt`), `tools` (`pct`, `remaining`,
`resetAt`), `models`, `today` (`available`, `date`, `rollsOverAt`, `tokens`,
`calls`, `models[]` with `name`/`tokens`, `tools` with `search`/`reader`/
`zread`).

`today` comes from two further monitor endpoints, `model-usage` and
`tool-usage`, both taking `startTime`/`endTime` in `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss` —
they reject ISO-8601 with a `T`. The bounds are the plain **local calendar
date**, sent without timezone conversion, because that is what the vendor's
dashboard does and matching it is the whole point of the figure (verified
digit-for-digit against a live account). The service applies those bounds on
its own clock, which runs ahead of Europe, so the day being summed is shifted
and the total stops growing before local midnight; `rollsOverAt` carries the
date change so a total that has stopped moving does not read as stuck. Neither
call can fail the provider: the quota windows are the point, and a missing
statistic must not cost them.

**copilot** — `hasKey`, `keyValid`, `username`, `used`, `quota`, `pct`,
`resetAt`.

**deepseek** — `hasKey`, `keyValid`, `isAvailable`, `balances`,
`primaryCurrency`, `primaryTotal`, `primaryGranted`, `primaryToppedUp`,
`currency`, `symbol`.

### Shared sub-objects

`stats` (Claude Code and Codex CLI): `available`, `totalMessages`,
`totalSessions`, `totalTokens`, `totalToolCalls`, `favoriteModel`, `firstDate`,
`computedDate`, `activeDays`, `spanDays`, `currentStreak`, `longestStreak`,
`longestSessionMs`, `longestSessionMessages`, `peakHour`, `models`,
`dailyTokens[]` (`date`, `total`). Claude adds `version`, `totalCostUSD` and
`totalWebSearches`; Codex adds `model` and `effortLevel`.

`status` (Statuspage summary): `indicator`, `description`, `components[]`,
`incidents[]`, `latestUpdate`. Status pages are cached on disk for
`AI_USAGE_STATUS_TTL` seconds (default 300) so a fast poll interval does not
hammer them.

## Shared frontend code

Three things are identical in both QML frontends and live in
`package/contents/code/` so they cannot drift (the terminal frontend keeps no
history and formats its own countdowns from `resetText`):

- `Format.js` — countdown formatting (`countdown`, `countdownFromEpoch`).
- `UsageHistory.js` — collecting `historyValues` from a response, merging into
  the rolling series, migrating legacy points, and replaying quota resets.

Persistence is currently a Quickshell-only concern: it writes
`~/.local/share/ai-usage-widget/usage-history-latest.json` as its history
mirror. The GNOME extension does not render a chart yet, so it has nothing to
persist.

## Testing

`tests/get-ai-usage.test.sh` replays `tests/fixtures/*.json` — raw envelopes for
success, missing credentials, malformed responses, offline and rate-limited
states — through `--normalize`, so the whole provider matrix is covered without
network access. It also runs the real backend end to end against the providers'
own fixture hooks (`*_RESPONSE_FILE`, honoured by `fetch_json` in
`aiusage/http.py`) to check settings toggles, key plumbing and the outer
envelope.

`tests/ai-usage-cli.test.sh` renders each of those fixtures through the terminal
frontend, asserting among other things that a provider which cannot report still
produces a row — a state the graphical frontends show as a tab or a pill, and
which a table could silently drop instead.

`tests/shared-code.test.js` covers the shared frontend modules. Run them all
with `make test`.

## Changing the contract

Adding a field is backwards compatible. Removing or repurposing one is not:
bump `SCHEMA_VERSION` in `package/contents/tools/aiusage/contract.py`, update
this document, and update all three frontends in the same change.
